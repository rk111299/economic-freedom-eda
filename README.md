# economic-freedom-eda

This short project is an elementary exploratory data analysis in Python using JupyterLab of three chosen variables from the 2021 Index of Economic Freedom dataset by the Heritage foundation. In it, I pre-process the data, and find measures of central tendency, as well as correlations between two variables. 
The data used is available here https://www.heritage.org/index/download
